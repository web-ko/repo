					<h3>People in Leli's Focus</h3>
					<h4>Leli Blagonravova's podcast</h4>
					<h5>1 February, 2026</h5>
					<p>&ldquo;What does painting give me, unlike photography? I think there is something more continuous here. I mean, in photography, things are still fixed, maybe what Gerhard Richter was fighting for, some fleeting moments are fixed, and he wants to unravel these moments and tell you that this is not now, this moment, but this is a long-term thought of the mind, when something follows you for a long time, when someone's face follows you for a long time, and it must even be a little blurry... Painting is also fixed, but it is more possible to generalize in it.&rdquo;</p>

					<h3>Given Time</h3>
					<h4>Solo Exhibition</h4>
					<h5>25  November – 4 December, 2025</h5>
					<p>&ldquo;What is the time given to us? Does it exist, or is it a figment of our imagination? And what does “given to us” mean? Why do we cross paths with someone or something? Sometimes we are here, in this time, and sometimes there, in another time.</p>
					<p>Somewhere in the virtual world we can create or destroy. Surely that, too, will have its reality. What is seen from afar is sometimes right there and real, while what stands beside us suddenly loses its weight and disappears.</p>
					<p>Reality changes when the visible and the invisible, the virtual and the tangible, exchange places unnoticeably.&rdquo;</p>

					<h3>Our Lives Unfolded Across Time</h3>
					<h4>1TV's Visit to the Studio</h4>
					<h5>27 January, 2024</h5>
					<p>&ldquo;My main subject of research is human. I am interested in people and I don't like to express my emotions directly. I am more interested in how my emotions are reflected in human beings and I try to show them from that point of view.</p>
					<p>Perhaps existentially I'm more focused on time and human existence in that time. Human attempts to do something just fascinate me, and I want to express that, our life unfolding in time.&rdquo;</p>

					<h4>Group Exhibition at N9Gallery</h4>
					<h5>19 December, 2023</h5>
					<p>&ldquo;There is a feeling in life that you carry with you all the time. It is not connected with time, you do not remember it, but it exists with you, you do not forget it, and it will always be with you.</p>
					<p>It may be from childhood or something later, but it is indelible and vivid. To me, it's a celebration that a person carries with them all the time. I would say, “an unbreakable holiday,” as Hemingway would say.&rdquo;</p>

					<h3>People – Main Inspiration</h3>
					<h4>Artarea's Visit to the Studio</h4>
					<h5>11 July, 2022</h5>
					<p>&ldquo;I often hear stories about how a person lives an ordinary life, and then something happens in their life and they perform an act that reveals other qualities. Maybe that's why I put them in different environments: sometimes I take them out on the street, sometimes I send them to a factory... It's as if I'm looking for what they're doing here...</p>
					<p>I am constantly looking at a person and I want to unravel their reality, which I know I can't unravel, it's inexplicable, but I still want to understand where their limits are, what they are capable of.&rdquo;</p>

					<h3>About Culture</h3>
					<h4>1TV's Visit to the Studio</h4>
					<h5>29 June, 2022</h5>
					<p>&ldquo;Is culture a pressure on the artist? One involuntarily recalls the Dadaist movement of the early 20th century, whose participants did not strive to create something valuable or to rely on such levers as society, morality, ethics, religion... but strove to free themselves from this “pressure”, likening themselves to a child who saw the world for the first time, and out of it arose a vague combination of sounds - “dada”, meaning nothing, purity.&rdquo;</p>

					<h3>Improper Intersections</h3>
					<h4>About Solo Exhibition on 1TV</h4>
					<h5>6 June, 2022</h5>
					<p>&ldquo;At times we want to displace our sensations that we have experienced in certain circumstances, and locate them onto an entirely different surface bringing about an ‘improper’ coalition or mixture. Where can we draw a line between reality and these sensations? Which surface are we then standing on right now?</p>
					<p>If we envisage objects as a space of thoughts and ideas, as a rigid sensation that has stayed in the same juxtaposition and combination in which we had left it; if we envisage them as an investment made by our thoughts that we have to displace and adjust to new surfaces and sensations, where will we end up?&rdquo;</p>
